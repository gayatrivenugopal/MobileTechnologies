Image Compression &amp; Decompression

ABSTRACT:-

The compression and decompression of continuous-tone images is important in document management and transmission systems. This paper considers an alternative image representation scheme, based on Gaussian derivatives, to the standard discrete cosine transformation (DCT), within a Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) framework. Depending on the computer arithmetic hardware used, the approach developed might yield a compression/decompression technique twice as fast as the DCT and of (essentially) equal quality
